    <h1>Identity and Values </h1> 
    <p class="para"> There are a few values that I identify with which are loyalty, hard work and commitment.</p>
        
    <p class="para">I learned my core values from my grandparents who had raised me, and I am blessed to have been gifted
          two role models for my upbringing. Both had showed me those values in different ways.</p>
          
    <p class="para">My grandad was one of the hardest workers I know, and he sadly had a stroke when I was very little, 
          but it did not change his outlook in life. He fought back from needing to relearn how talk and walk 
          to being able to walk me to and from primary school. He showed me what hard work and commitment was all about.</p>
    
    <p class="para">My nan showed me the same values by the way she cared for all of us. She had been told when grandad 
          first got the stroke that he would only have months to live, that did not stop her from being there 
          for grandad and helping him with his recovery and proving the doctors wrong with him living for years 
          after the stroke.</p>
    </p>
    <p class="para"> Whenever a situation does arise where I feel conflicted and or indecisive, I can look at my 
      upbringing and the values I have been taught to guide my decision whether it is right or wrong. One such 
      situation occurred was when I was in high school, and I had to decide whether to follow the crowd or not. 
      In high school I had a close bunch of friends around five of us and as with all groups their can be infighting. 
      In one situation while we were going to the park to play some touch rugby my friend decided to try to exclude 
      another friend from going to the park and uninviting him from their birthday party that weekend. The excluded 
      friend decided to go home instead of going to the park, I felt this was not right and decided to walk home with 
      him. Loyalty is very important and to me the decision was do I follow the others and allow them to do a 
      disservice to another friend or stick to my values. The short-term outcome of my decision is that the rest of my 
      friends decided to join us in the end by walking home and that I also did not go to the party. The long-term 
      outcomes were that the friend I walked home with is married and has a baby boy who is my godson, so it was 
      worth the trade.  </p>

    <h1>Strengths and Limitations</h1>
    <p class="para">Strengths</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard Working</li>
      <li>Independent</li>
      <li>Willing to listen to others</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">Limitations</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Communication</li>
      <li>Stubborn</li>
      <li>Unfocused</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">I believe that being able to listen to other opinion can help me with learning obstacles. I 
      might not like change but if someone is able to give me a valid opinion, I am willing to take that and try to 
      be better.</p>
    
    <p class="para">In one situation I had at work we were trialling a new process that will increase health and 
      safety in the workplace. We had two shifts a morning and an afternoon shift trialling out the new process. 
      Tension happened when after a week of doing the new process when the team leaders of both shifts came together 
      for a meeting about the process, we had realised that we were not doing it the exact same way. This caused 
      tension as both shifts believe their method for doing the new process was better and was not willing to change. 
      After a lot of debate, we decided as a leadership group to trial the otherâ€™s shift method that way we can see 
      if the method will work for the other shift. It was effective to a point as it showed the limitations that each 
      method had which caused us to find a way to have the best parts of both methods.</p>
