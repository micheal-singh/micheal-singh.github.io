    <h1>HTML, CSS and DOM</h1>
    
    <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p class="para"> A cake is a good analogy to show the difference between HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p class="para"> Html is the base of the cake which is functional and tasty.</p>
        <p class="para"> Css is the decorations that makes the cake look fancy and stylish.</p>

    <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
        <p class="para">Control flow are satements in Java that controls the flow of the code.</p>
        <p class="para">There are three types of control flow statement which are decision making, loop and jump statements.</p>
        <p class="para">Decision making statements are ifs and switch statements. If statements are statements that allows 
          the program to execute code when conditions are true if not it will not execute. Switch statements are like if 
          statements but there are multiple codes that can be executed instead of one.</p> 
        <p class="para"> Loop statements are statements that will continue to be executed while the conditions are true. 
          Jump statements are statements that are used to interrupt loop and decision making statements. 
          </p>
        <p class="para">An example of a control flow in everyday life is when following instructions on baking a cake 
          you must follow each step from 1 to 3 to ensure the cake is baked correctly. </p>
        <p class="para">An example of a loop statement is like eating a slice of cake for you to have an empty plate you 
          must finish the cake. </p>

    <h2>DOM</h2>
        <p class="para">The DOM is the Document Object Model is a programming interface for the HTML or XML documents. 
          It gives us a tree structure that can help programmers to use it as a guide on how to bring forth elements. 
          The tree structure starts with the document and ends with the element tags such as the anchor tags or heading tags. </p>
    
    <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <p class="para">Both objects and array are items that are placed in variables. Objects are usually used to 
          describe characteristics such as names and age where arrays are used to list items such as list of fruits and 
          place them in numerical order. </p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p class="para">A function is a piece code that allows the program to complete specific tasks. The reason 
          this is useful is that without functions a person would have to repeat the code over and over in the program 
          to ensure the task is done where the programmer wants to be done. This would cause the code to be over long 
          and very unorganised.  </p>
