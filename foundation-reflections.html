    <h1>Foundation Reflection</h1>
    
    <h2>Core learnings</h2>
    <p class="para"> The three things I have learnt about myself is my mindset, they way I listen to people and the 
      training of emotional intelligence. </p>
    <p class="para"> After learning from the core tasks, I found that my mind can be in a fixed mindsets when it 
      came to challenges and obstacles. Instead of embracing challenges and being fine with setbacks I would avoid 
      both like the plague. This helped me learn that change can happen in the mindset if we are willing to persist.</p>
    <p class="para">I had learnt how to actively listen to others due to the looping challenges which forced actually 
      listen to the other person without judgement or critiques. This has helped me better listen to the people I have 
      talked to. </p>
    <p class="para"> Emotional intelligence is something I had heard about but never tried to train and with the learning 
      I have found how important it is to train if you want to better relate with people and for them to relate to you. </p>

    <h2>Values, Empathy & Self-awareness</h2>
    <p class="para">The roles of values, empathy and self-awareness is that it forces you to take a hard look at yourself 
      and they way you treat yourself and others. Values is the foundation that pushes you to continue learning even when 
      you feel like you want to give up. Empathy is important to not judge or feel envious about others. Everyone has their 
      challenges and obstacles the must overcome you can either be another obstacle in their way or be someone that can help 
      them in their challenges. Being aware of yourself is important as it help you understand yourself better. Without being 
      self-aware you will find it hard to improve yourself as you will not put a spotlight on areas where you can improve. </p>

    <h2>Surprise and Challenge</h2>
    <p class="para">What has surprised and challenge me is that you can change is you are willing. The core learning is 
      about teaching you that you can change and improve yourself. Each lesson teaches you about looking at yourself and how 
      training either your mind or listening skills can improve the way you learn and see the world. The challenging part is 
      pushing myself to try it as I have been used to thinking and learning a certain way trying something new can feel daunting 
      at times. </p>

    <h2>Importance of Core Learning</h2>
    <p class="para">The importance of core learning is that the workplace is about interactions with others and learning to 
      deal with change. You might be the best programmer but if you are unable to interact well with others then the group morale 
      will go down and overall performance will go down. Our life is ever changing and so is the workplace and if you get stuck in 
      your ways you might get left behind. That is why core learning is important as it gives you lessons and training that you 
      can used to improve your interactions with others and how to deal with change. </p>
