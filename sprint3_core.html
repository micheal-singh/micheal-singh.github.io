    <h1>EQ vs IQ</h1>
    
      <h2>Emotional Intelligence - EQ</h2>
        <p class="para"> EQ can be said that a person with high EQ is able to read the room. 
          It is their ability to identify emotions from themselves and others and being able 
          to use that information to improve a situation. Emotional intelligence is about being 
          empathetic to other feelings and being able to communicate well with others.</p>
    
      <h2>Intelligence Quotient - IQ</h2>
        <p class="para"> IQ can be said that a person with high IQ usually the smartest person 
          in the room. It is their ability to use logical reasoning and knowledge they have gained 
          to solve their problems.</p>

      <h2>Importance of having EQ</h2>
        <p class="para"> The importance of having EQ is that with high EQ you can build good relationships 
          and create a positive environment for people to be around. This can be seen in most iteration 
          of Sherlock Holmes in which Sherlock has very high IQ and Watson his dear friend has very high EQ. 
          This is a great balance as Sherlock can come off as an intellectual snob which witnesses would 
          have a hard time talking too. This means he might not be able to gain vital information to solve 
          the case, but as he has Watson who is able to communicate well and empathise with the witnesses, 
          that a safe environment will be created for the witness to give more information. This information 
          would then help Sherlock solve the case.</p>
