    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <h2>Simple Problem Troubles</h2>
      <p class="para">One simple problem issue I came across is when I 
        created my navigation bar and one of my webpages was not linking 
        with the rest. When I would click to it from another page it would 
        not open. I first got frustrated but then I started to check what 
        my other web page codes had that this webpage and from a process of 
        elimination I was able to find that the link to the webpage was incorrect. 
        Once I had found that I was overjoyed and relived, and I learnt to not get 
        frustrated too quickly. </p>

      <h2>Elegant Problem Solving</h2>
      <p class="para">A problem I had with one of the Kata was having Terah’s children 
        be the same as Adam’s children. When I got the error saying that Terah’s children 
        needed to be Adam’s children I did not get frustrated this time as I had been able 
        to get through the rest of the testing with a good understanding on what needed to 
        be able to pass the tests. When I trialed the first code It did not work which was 
        ok cause it was a start. I looked at the testing code and then did a second code which 
        did work. Throughout I was a lot calmer but still overjoyed when I passed the test. What 
        I learnt is that trial and error is part of improving our skills.</p>
